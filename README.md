# A Web-based Adventure Game!

- Created June 2020

## Visit https://liberatoaguilar.github.io/Map/Map.html to Play!

This (nameless) game is the start of a fun project in my quest to learn javascript. It is a simple game that takes inspiration from many other games that you may recognize when playing it.

- Move with the arrow keys.
- You can stay on the original map or create your own!
  - If you do be sure to save!
- Trips are recorded every time you return home (H).
- Mazes (M) contain chests (C) that may add items to your bag.
  - Be careful in Mazes, if you run out of walljumpers you will get stuck!
  - Mazes are randomly generated using a maze generating algorithm found in anther project.
- Be sure to stay on the roads (X) because monsters can appear in the wilderness (0).
- Export exports your current map to share with others. Upload allows the uploading of new maps.
- Don't forget to save your progress!

- This game is unfinished, more is to come!
